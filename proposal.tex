Traditional error mitigation techniques such as Error Correcting Code (ECC)
has limited error coverage rate at the cost of performance and area overhead. Another solution widely used in
industry namely Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) in Lockstep consists of two redundant cores executing the same application
in lockstep. Both results are compared and only on a match that the data will be commited to the outside world. 
Resolving the issue of performance impact, lockstep execution has been shown to be a great waste of computational
power. Therefore in this project we propose to implement Execution fingerprinting which will greatly enhance the performance
of a DMR.


\section{Targets}

For the course of this project we plan to:
\begin{itemize}
\item A single core execution fingerprinting will be designed using CRC
\item 2 CRC layout will be designed to fit the MIPS8 multicycle processor that will generate the fingerprints
\item The generated fingerprints will be stored in a buffer
\item The performance impact, area overhead and error coverage will be evaluated
\end{itemize}

The fingerprinting design will consist of monitering the output ports of the current MIPS8 processor. 
Then it will be compressed using the CRC circuit, generating a fingerprint. This fingerprint will then be
stored in a buffer.
By the mid-project status report, we target to finish the layout of both CRC circuits for a functional
fingerprinting circuit. From that point, we will be able to optimize the circuit according to the behavior
of the MIPS8 core. Then, a series of benchmarks will be executed in order to analyse the performance
impact, area overhead and error coverage of the circuit.
